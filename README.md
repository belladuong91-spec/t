# Log Scanner Reflection

## Keywords Searched
Keywords I searched for: **error**, **failed login**, and **unauthorized**. These keywords are commonly associated with suspicious or failed security events, that may indicate misconfigurations or attacks.

## Use for Security Analysts
This script be used by a security analyst to quickly filter massive log files and identify any unsual events faster like : unauthorized system access or failed login.

## Possible Improvements
To make this a more advanced tool, I could add:
- Add timesstamp to identify suspicious time-based patterns
- Look up, extract and count unique IP addresses associated with failed logins, ths action is to flag any unsual IP numbers.
